# How to hack

Hacking is done by breaking the **pro**(tection) on a **silo** to gain access to the data or processing power inside for your own use.

In the connected world today, hacking is similar to flying a jetfighter using IFF, jammers and air-lanes to appear to be a civilian or friendly aircraft.

To conduct these tasks, you will have a **dev**(ice) running **app**(lications) and incase your hacks fail you likely will have **enc**apsulation to protect your device and self from damage.

----

## silo
A silo is a corporate, department or ministry resource centre. Most applications will communicate with silos to conduct business.
When you make a purchase your wallet app will communicate with the Bank Silo, and possibly the Tax Silo after the transaction. A lot of minor applications will only communicate with Silos once a week or less often, and some systems are dispersed a rely very little on silos.

When a hacker communicates with a silo, often they gain resources: 
- info, 
- cash,
- notoriety, or;
- a new/upgraded **app**, **dev** or **enc**.

----

## pro
Pro is the the *protocol* or *protection* a Silo uses to confirm the **app** attempting communication is authorised to access and conduct business etc.
*(Pro is designed to prevent unauthorised, malicious or a spurious communication.)*

Pro will have a combination of 5 flavours:

#### Protocol
- **loc** - location (being inside the geo-fence for requests etc.)
- **tic** - time protection (knowing to time sequence to make a request)
- **toc** - response (knowing when and how to answer)
#### Protection
- **pwd** - passwords (having a key that lets you make a request)
- **tkn** - tokens (making a request with special data)


## app
An **app** will have the same 5 flavours as **pro**. Often an **app** is designed to combat 1 or more layers of **pro** on a **silo**. 
Sophisticated **pro** may depleat some flavour of an **app**.

Each **app** is loaded into a **dev** mem.
Before making a hacking roll, you will have to load your apps into your devs. Some apps can not be cloned, or will have a maximum mem they can be loaded to.

----

## hacking roll

When you hack, you take a risk - attempt to communicate with a silo and go for a roll.

1. You select a silo, and pop the outer most layer of **pro**.

2. You will then select an **app** *to combat the* **pro**.

3. If your app matches or betters the pro, **you defeat the pro** (and the app will not be able to be used again this roll).
---
**If your app is less than the pro**, then you fail. Depending on the pro this could cause you to end the run, or you will have **neg**
---
4. repeat step 2-3 until you have defeated all the pro. (or decide to *dodge* and stop the roll) 
5. **Once you have deafeated all the pro** you will then get to **communicate with the silo**.

*Note: Some silos will also have pro after your communication. To disconnect from a classified or secure silo you will have to defeat more pro.*


### failing (taking neg)
If you get defeated by **pro** you will likely take on neg.
Maybe it will be a tracker, that makes your apps less effective, or damage to your **dev**.

If you have good **enc** it will cancel the **neg**.
When you start, you have a *cyber-fuse* that you can use one time only to cancel up to 5 neg.
Without a *cyber-fuse*, the neg will destroy your dev/s, and you will take any excess damage (GAME OVER).


### dodge
If you fear the roll will fail, you can *dodge*, end the run and return to base for an *app* reload, rethink etc.
(Some **Silo** may require you to combat **pro** to *dodge*)
